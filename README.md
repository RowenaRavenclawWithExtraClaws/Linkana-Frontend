# Linkana Frontend

Linkana is an interactive admin dashboard for managing IoT devices. It's a demonstration of my skills in the front-end.

### Installation

- Clone this repo.
- Navigate to the project folder.
- Run `npm start` and start playing with it.

### What can you do?

This demo dashboard allows the user to:

- Display data for devices, commands, and apps.
- Do `CRUD` operations on devices, commands, apps, and users.
- Access a device via a terminal interface.
- Display the current location of each device.
- Customize the overview page UI by dragging and resizing widgets.

Note: The project contains other files and react components this demo does not cover them but, you can of course take a look at them :)

### Third-party libraries:

- Bootstrap: For styling.
- Reactstrap: For constructing UI components.
- Redux: For state management.
- Leaflet: For displaying devices' location.
- react-fa-icon-picker: For selecting icons for commands and apps.
- react-responsive-carousel: For displaying a nice carousel.
- recordrtc: For recording voice in the browser.
- react-grid-layout: For making draggable and resizable widgets (check the overview page).
- toastr: For displaying a nice toast after making an action the data.
- reactour: For displaying tour modals.
- monaco-editor-v2: For writing install, update, and remove commands for apps.
- xterm: For accessing devices via a terminal interface.

Note: There is a folder called screenshots which contains screenshots from the dashboard for a quick look :)
